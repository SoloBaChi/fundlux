			<h1>client education</h1>
			<p>
				As Fundlux Financial Management's client, we want you to understand what’s going on with your portfolio and, more importantly, the reasoning behind our decision making. That’s why we have multiple ways we regularly keep you up-to-date and informed on the markets, our outlook and the reasoning behind our strategic portfolio decisions
			</p>
			<h4>quarterly review</h4>
			<p>
				Each quarter you will receive an extensive report published under the direction of the Investment Policy Committee with input from our research staff. In it, we discuss recent market performance and our future market outlook. We also explain our views on current global economic and financial trends, and might cover such topics like:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>What period in history the current stock market most closely resembles &quest;</li>
				<li>How and why prior presidential elections have impacted stocks &quest;</li>
				<li>What emergent trend could determine beating the market or lagging &quest;</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				The goal of this detailed report is to help you understand how current economic and political events are impacting the global stock market. We believe it’s a level of education and transparency few money managers provide to their clients.
			</p>
			<h4>MarketMinder</h4>
			<p>
				This commentary, now available to the general public, was originally created for Fundlux Financial Management's clients. MarketMinder is a source of “straight talk” about the financial markets, with the goal of helping investors understand whether market events are bullish or bearish, and why. The articles are updated every business day by Fundlux Financial Managements’ editorial staff, who scour over 100 periodicals, blogs and other sources to identify relevant financial news. We provide daily commentary on the markets and highlight stories in the financial media we believe investors should either pay attention to, or ignore.
